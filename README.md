**Project Overview**
--------------------------------
The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process based on customer detail provided while filling the online application form. 
Construct a Machine Learning model to predict a person's eligibility of loan approval based on some information about that person. 


Datasets to be Used:

*Breakdown of Tasks:*
---------------------------------

Data Prepartion and Analysis

    Load and Explore the Datasets:

          Use Python Pandas to load the datasets.

          Explore the data, understand the columns and identify key features for analysis.


 Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets (Already provided from kaggle CSVs)

         Create the labels set from the loan_status column, and then create the features DataFrame from the remaining columns. 


 Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

         Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data

         Evaluate the model's performance by generating a confusion matrix.


 Visualizations (Tableau)

       Use Tableau to generate visualizations.
